### 🌟 Bonus Features

Want to make it even more interactive? Here are some fun ideas you can add:

1. **Badges**: You can display build status, test coverage, and other cool metrics. For example:
   - Build Status: ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/youruser/yourproject)
   - Test Coverage: ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/github/youruser/yourproject)

2. **Interactive Examples**: Add a small code snippet or CLI interaction guide. For example:

   ```sh
   # Enter a numeric grade to get the level grade!
   java -jar LevelGrader-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 85
   ```
